Greetings,

My name is Nischal Binil and I am currently working as an Intern at Futurense Technologies. 
Through the course of this internship, I aim to work on projects with my team 
and simultaneously learn to work on platforms such as GitHub, Git, Agile etc. 
as well as to increase my programming knowledge in Python, C, C++, and Java.
